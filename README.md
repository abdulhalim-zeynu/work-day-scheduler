This schedule is for an employee with a busy schedule.
You are able to add important events to a daily planner so that you can manage your time effectively


Given you are using a daily planner to create a schedule,
<br>
When you open the planner,
then the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
<br>
When you scroll down,
then you are presented with timeblocks for standard business hours.
<br>
When you view the timeblocks for that day,
then each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
<br>
When you click into a timeblock,
then you can enter an event.
<br>
When you click the save button for that timeblock,
then the text for that event is saved in local storage.
<br>
When you refresh the page,
then the saved events persist.
<br>
Enjoy!
